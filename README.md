# Machine Learning Snippets

This repository contains short, practical, and beginner friendly code snippets I’m uploading over 100 days to strengthen my machine learning understanding.  
Each snippet is focused on a specific concept, technique, or best practice, like handling missing data, model evaluation, or tuning parameters.

## Libraries Used

The snippets mostly use the following Python libraries:

- **Pandas** – data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations and arrays  
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning models, metrics, preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch** for deep learning
